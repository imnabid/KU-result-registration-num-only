## NOT WORKING!! KU CHANGED THE RESULT PORTAL
## University Result Portal CAPTCHA Bypass

This project bypasses CAPTCHA recognition on a university result portal by using an automated CAPTCHA recognition technique. It scrapes results by simulating user inputs (like registration number and date of birth) and handles CAPTCHA generation using Optical Character Recognition (OCR).

## Features

- Automated CAPTCHA recognition using EasyOCR and OpenCV.
- Asynchronous requests to efficiently query the result portal.
- Saves the result as a PDF if found.
  
## To get started:

- pip install -r requirements.txt

- KU result page: http://101.251.6.66/index.php

- Place the registration number and other requirements

- Enter the start and end birth date range and simply run main.py

If successful you will see a result.pdf in the working directory on an average time of 6 sec
